Dear students,

00:00:03.024 --> 00:00:06.171
members of the Vilnius University community

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:08.195
dear VU SR community,

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.937
Another year of our activity has passed.

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:12.961
Very diverse, which required difficult decisions

00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:15.938
but brought new changes both at the university and

00:00:15.963 --> 00:00:17.969
in Lithuanian higher education

00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:23.672
Individual Studies - an idea that VU SR at our University sought to implement in more than five years

00:00:23.697 --> 00:00:28.047
in order to provide each student with maximum opportunities

00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:31.719
to choose their own path of study - this year not only was accepted

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:34.844
but also already implemented.

00:00:35.313 --> 00:00:38.047
Development of the social dimension in higher education  –

00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:42.969
the Seimas approved the concept of the social dimension of higher education and provided for opportunities

00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:48.906
for the state to finance additional measures of social, academic, informational, financial assistance;

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:52.813
The second row of admission, which will allow individuals from less representative groups

00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:56.094
groups in higher education to receive higher education

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:59.063
and our own implementation of the student-ambassador project ,

00:00:59.088 --> 00:01:02.656
aimed at purposefully increasing aspirations for scholars in the regions.

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:08.827
All this is the result of the consistent work of VU SR, both these years and the close to 10 years.

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:12.266
Increased salaries of residents and attention to doctoral students

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:19.055
At the same time, it was still a time of assistance to Ukraine and concern for the opportunities of foreign students.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.539
By acting on a daily basis to bring changes for students, we have also made progress in the Organization by reflecting,

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:28.664
being an even more open space for student initiatives

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.430
and taking the lead to achieving greater sustainability within the Organization.

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:37.805
I am proud of the Organization - we would not have done all these

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.086
 and a bunch of things that have not yet been listed without strong partnerships and united work together!

00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:43.195
So I say a huge THANK YOU to everyone

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.102
who has contributed to making it better for the students and the Organization.

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:50.617
And further - I invite you to get acquainted with the works and changes

00:01:50.642 --> 00:01:52.961
that we have created and for which we have laid the foundations!

00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:55.305
Unitedly for the Future of Students!
