# Projects

During the reference period, VU SR implemented the following projects:

## Project "ECSTRA: Employability Competencies for Students Through implementation and Recognition of Activities"

One of the key competences needed to work and live in the twenty-first century is initiative and entrepreneurship, i.e. the ability of a person to turn ideas into action. We believe that higher education institutions must help students to acquire these skills, therefore VU SR is implementing a project aimed at helping students to acquire the necessary competencies (entrepreneurship, cooperation, problem solving, sustainability and creation of social innovations) through volunteering activities, during which real-life problems would be solved using social innovations. During the implementation of the project, together with our partners, we have developed a volunteer coordination guide for the empowerment of the student community, a canvas, and a guide for the creation of initiatives, e-modules for students involved in volunteering activities - from public speaking to the development of conflict resolution skills. We have also developed guidelines for the crediting of competences acquired in a non-formal way, tasks for the assessment of competencies. At the end of the project, we organized a results presentation event, where the students who participated also created cooperation initiatives and used the results created during the project.

## Application of good foreign practices for the implementation of the social dimension in Lithuanian higher education by reducing the barriers faced by less representative groups in higher education  

This project implemented the initiative "Higher education is not TOO high", created a network of student ambassadors, the purpose of which is to acquaint students at schools in the regions with the possibilities of higher education and inspire them to pursue higher education. 45 Vilnius University students joined the network of student ambassadors, who visited 22 schools throughout Lithuania. During the meetings, students presented the system of higher education, talked about the possibilities of financial support, and shared their experiences. A total of 771 scholars attended the meetings. Together with the Ministry of Education, Science and Sports of the Republic of Lithuania, an international conference "The Social Dimension in Lithuanian Higher Education" was organized. During the implementation of the project, an overview of the effectiveness of measures of the social dimension in higher education and the possibilities of application in Lithuania was prepared, and advocacy of the social dimension was engaged.
