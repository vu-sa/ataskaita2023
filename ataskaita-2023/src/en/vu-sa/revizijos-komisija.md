# The Revision Commission

The Revision Commission is a controlling body performing financial and
operational inspection of VU SR self-government institutions, VU SR
subdivisions and other structural units of VU SR, as well as legal entities
established by VU SR. The commission consists of five members elected
at the VU SR annual convention.

**During the reference period, the Revision Commission consisted of:**

- Evaldas Matijošaitis (Chairman of the Commission)
- Ieva Šukytė

During 2022-2023 the Revision commission improved the methodology for
evaluating the performance of VU SR and, according to it, carried out
an evaluation of the organization's activities. During the reporting period,
2 open meetings of the Revision Commission and 8 closed working meetings were
held; during individual or group meetings with the units being reviewed,
the members of the commission met more than 230 times. At these meetings,
it was checked whether the Council and Parliament of VU SR, VU SR CAU,
VU SR PCP, VU SR Data Protection and Consulting Groups, VU SR ISF and VU SR
meet the qualitative and quantitative evaluation criteria. Information
was also collected by the Revision Commission participating in the meetings
of the VU SR Parliament and the Council, trainings conducted by the
organization, planning of strategic goals and other events.

Also, the Revision Commission consulted the members of VU SR and
provided answers to their questions related to the activities and
legal acts of VU SR, provided clarifications of documents regulating
activities during the term of office and appealed to the VU SR Council
in response to situations regarding the preparation of camp estimates
and the organization of reporting-election conferences of units.

The report on the evaluation of the organization's activities is submitted
by the Revision Commission during the VU SR annual convention (the evaluation
report is available <https://vusa.lt/lt/veiklos-ir-tyrimu-ataskaitos>).
