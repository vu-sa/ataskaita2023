# A Sustainable University Community

Fostering community spirit and integration of students remains an
important priority of Vilnius University Students' Representation. For
several years in a row, VU SR has been actively taking care of the offer
of socio-academic and community events, strengthening and expanding
projects, clubs and programs that are open to all members of the VU
community. In this way, VU SR promotes a cohesive, open community that
fosters University traditions.
